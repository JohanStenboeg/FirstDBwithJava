**What this program does:**
The file contains 4 different classes. DB_Connector, DB_Statements, Login_GUI and TestClass. 
The DB_Connector makes a connection to my local database. With a nubmber of try/catch, to catch any erros without crashing the program. 
The DB_Statements adds some statements or methods to insert or select things in the database. To create a database or table and check login. 
The Login_GUI is a little GUI that i've hardcoded that promts the user to type in username and password before the user can acces the database. 
The TestClass is the only class with a main, that uses the other classes and to test if everything work.
